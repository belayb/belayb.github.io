        <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
   <p> I'm a statistician at the University of Manchester, Center for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis. </p>
    <p>I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Hasselt University, Belgium, my MSc in Biostatistics 
      from Jimma University and my BSc in applied statistics from Hawassa University, Ethiopia.  </p>

    <p>As a statistician, I specialized in Bayesian and computational statistics, 
      with a particular focus on building flexible statistical models, including 
      multilevel/hierarchical models, multistate survival models, and additive 
      and additive mixed-effects modelling. I've applied these methods to problems 
      arising from infectious diseases (e.g., short-term COVID-19 forecasting, 
      malaria vector distribution over time, and time-to-treatment switching 
      in HIV-positive patients) and chronic diseases (e.g., daily pain severity
       modelling and individual heterogeneity quantification). 
    </p>
    <p>Since September 2017, I have been working at the University of Manchester as a Research Associate in Biostatistics, contributing to the design, analysis and reporting of epidemiological studies. Before joining the University of Manchester, I worked as a lecturer (Assistant Professor) of statistics at Jimma University, Ethiopia. During my time at Jimma University, I led the Principles of statistical inference course for the Master's program in Biostatistics and supervised eight MSc student dissertation projects. In addition, I co-led two VLIRâ€“UOS-funded capacity-building projects in statistics.    </p>
